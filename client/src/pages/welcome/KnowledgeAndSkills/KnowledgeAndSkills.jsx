        <h3>My Knowledge and Skills</h3>
        <p>
            As a web developer, I have a strong foundation in HTML and CSS, and I'm experienced in building responsive and
            accessible websites. I also have a solid understanding of JavaScript, both vanilla and with frameworks like React.
            On the backend, I'm proficient in JavaScript with Node.js, as well as PHP with Laravel, and I have experience working
            with databases like MySQL. I pride myself on writing clean, maintainable code and staying up-to-date with the latest
            industry standards and best practices. I'm always looking for opportunities to learn and grow, and I'm excited to
            apply my skills to create innovative and impactful solutions.
